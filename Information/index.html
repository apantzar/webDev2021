                <p > Pollution is anything that is present or introduced into an environment which causes harm.  In the sea there are many kinds of pollution such as rubbish, oil, chemicals,noise etc.<br><br></p>
                <p > In the last ten years the waters have borne the brunt of serious pollution accidents, but these are becoming less common as technologies develop and the affects become better understood.  But, there is still an awful lot to learn about the effects of polluting marine environments.  Often the pollution cannot be seen by the naked eye, and sometimes pollution will never disappear from the water.<br><br></p>
                <p > The majority of pollutants that make their way into the ocean come from human activities along the coastlines and far inland. One of the biggest sources of pollution is nonpoint source pollution, which occurs as a result of runoff. Nonpoint source pollution can come from many sources, like septic tanks, vehicles, farms, livestock ranches, and timber harvest areas.<br><br> </p>

          <h2>Industrial Pollution</h2>
          <div class="cards">
            <div class="text-card">
              <p>Industry is a huge source of water pollution, it produces pollutants that are extremely harmful to people and the environment.<br>

                Many industrial facilities use freshwater to carry away waste from the plant and into rivers, lakes and oceans.<br>
                
                Pollutants from industrial sources include:<br><br>
                
                 
                
                <b>Asbestos</b> – This pollutant is a serious health hazard and carcinogenic. Asbestos fibres can be inhaled and cause illnesses such as asbestosis, mesothelioma, lung cancer, intestinal cancer and liver cancer.<br>
                <b>Lead</b> – This is a metallic element and can cause health and environmental problems. It is a non-biodegradable substance so is hard to clean up once the environment is contaminated. Lead is harmful to the health of many animals, including humans, as it can inhibit the action of bodily enzymes.<br>
                <b>Mercury</b> – This is a metallic element and can cause health and environmental problems. It is a non-biodegradable substance so is hard to clean up once the environment is contaminated. Mercury is also harmful to animal health as it can cause illness through mercury poisoning.<br>
                <b>Nitrates</b> – The increased use of fertilisers means that nitrates are more often being washed from the soil and into rivers and lakes. This can cause eutrophication, which can be very problematic to marine environments.<br>
                <b>Phosphates</b> – The increased use of fertilisers means that phosphates are more often being washed from the soil and into rivers and lakes. This can cause eutrophication, which can be very problematic to marine environments.<br>
                <b>Sulphur</b> – This is a non-metallic substance that is harmful for marine life.
                Oilsy – Oil does not dissolve in water, instead it forms a thick layer on the water surface. This can stop marine plants receiving enough light for photosynthesis. It is also harmful for fish and marine birds.<br>
                <b>Petrochemicals</b> – This is formed from gas or petrol and can be toxic to marine life.</p>

              <p class="textc">Oil pollution can be caused by any spillage of crude oil or its refined products. However, the largest and most damaging pollution events usually involve spills of petroleum or heavy bunker fuel from disabled tankers or drill platforms at sea, from barges or ships on major inland waterways, or from blowouts of wells or broken pipelines on land.<br>

A spill on land can occur in many ways, but the largest events generally involve a pipeline rupture or a well blowout. Globally, in 1982 there were 64.5 thousand km of pipeline for the transportation of liquid petroleum and another 136 thousand km of natural gas pipeline (Gilroy, 1983). The causes of pipeline ruptures are diverse. They include faulty pumping equipment and pipe seam welds, earthquakes, sabotage, deliberate spillage as in the Gulf War, and sometimes hunters using aboveground pipelines for target practice. </p>

        <div class="txt">
          <p>
            The total quantity of oil spilled from pipelines is not well quantified in many parts of the world. However, because of the widespread use of spill sensors and mechanisms for shutting down sections of pipeline, individual events are usually much smaller than can potentially be spilled by oceanic supertankers or by blowouts of offshore platforms. Because the spread of spilled oil is much more restricted on land than on water, terrestrial spills usually affect relatively localized areas (unless the spilled oil reaches a watercourse). The characteristics and ecological effects of terrestrial spills are described in more detail later in this chapter, in the context of oil spills in the Arctic.<br>

  Much information is available about the magnitude, behavior, and effects of oil spilled at sea. Recent estimates of the input of petroleum hydrocarbons to the world's oceans during the 1970s and early 1980s ranged from about 3.2 to 6.1 million tonnes/year (Table 6.3). This was equivalent to about 0.2–0.3% of the total quantity of petroleum transported by tankers in 1980 and 0.1–0.2% of global petroleum production (Cormack, 1983). More recent estimates of global inputs of oil to the marine environment suggest that there was a substantial reduction during the 1980s, from 1.47 million tonnes in 1981 to 0.57 million tonnes in 1989 [International Marine Organization (IMO), 1990; GESAMP, 1993).

    <h1>Marine Life</h1>
    <p>The ocean is one of the most unexplored parts of our planet, with a magnitude of undiscovered species and mysteries. It turns out from the studies conducted over the last few decades, 
       this magnificent environment is under serious threat from human intervention, with plastics set to outnumber fish by 2050.
       <br>Marine life, as we know it, is suffering irreparable damage from the chemical pollution of the waters and the millions of tons of mismanaged waste dumped in the oceans each year. 
        The result is a planetary crisis with over 100 million marine animal’s lives get lost every year, and the decay of the ocean's ecosystem.<br>Almost 1,000 species of marine animals get 
        impacted by ocean pollution, and we now have over 500 locations recorded as dead zones where marine life cannot exist. How did this happen, what is causing the most damage, find out 
        everything below in the marine pollution statistics roundup.

   <h2>Coral extinction</h2>
   <p>
    For decades, marine scientists have been warning of the demise of coral reefs in a warming world. But now, those warning calls have reached a full-scale alarm, leaving researchers at a loss 
    for exactly how best to save the reefs. Due to the warming sea-surface temperatures, seawater acidification and plastic pollution, 50 percent of the world's coral reefs are now dead. <br>Reefs 
    occupy just 1% of the world’s marine environment, but they provide a home to a quarter of marine species—including a unique set of fish, turtles and algae. Many of these species could be 
    lost permanently.<br>The new study finds that 94 percent of surveyed coral reefs have experienced a severe bleaching event since the 1980s. Only six sites surveyed were unaffected. They are 
    scattered around the world, meaning no ocean basin on Earth has been entirely spared.<br>Some of the world’s top coral experts amounts to a last rites for the ecosystems often referred to 
    as “the tropical rainforests of the sea.” Scientists surveyed 100 reefs around the world and found that extreme bleaching events that once occurred every 25 or 30 years now happen about 
    every five or six years.<br>Bleaching happens when corals become overheated and expel the symbiotic algae that feed them. Without the algae to photosynthesize their food for them, corals 
    stop growing and become more susceptible to disease. If water temperatures remain too high for too long, the corals can die.

   <h2>Marine animals extinction</h2>
   <p>
    Over 2,000 species are currently on the ESA, and they are separated into "Threatened" and "Endangered" species. Endangered species are in danger of going extinct, while Threatened species 
    are approaching Endangered status.

   <h4>Overfishing and Bycatch</h4>
   <p>
    Overfishing occurs when more fish are caught than the population can replace through natural reproduction. Gathering as many fish as possible may seem like a profitable practice, but 
    overfishing has serious consequences. The results not only affect the balance of life in the oceans, but also the social and economic well-being of the coastal communities who depend on fish 
    for their way of life. More than 30 percent of the world's fisheries have been pushed beyond their biological limits and are in need of strict management plans to restore them. Several 
    important commercial fish populations (such as Atlantic bluefin tuna) have declined to the point where their survival as a species is threatened. Target fishing of top predators, such as 
    tuna and groupers, is changing marine communities. Overfishing even effects the abundance of smaller marine species, such as sardines and anchovies.<br>Wherever there is fishing, there is 
    bycatch - the incidental capture of  non-target species such as dolphins, marine turtles and seabirds.  Thousands of kilometers of nets and lines are set in the world's oceans each day. 
    Modern fishing gear, often undetectable by sight and extremely strong, is very efficient at catching the desired fish species—as well as anything else in its path. A staggering amount of 
    marine  life—including turtles, dolphins and juvenile fish - is hauled up with the catch, and then discarded overboard dead or dying. Fishing industry leaders increasingly realize the need 
    to reduce this phenomenon. Proven solutions do exist, such as modifying fishing gear so that fewer non-target species are caught or can escape. In many cases, these modifications are simple 
    and inexpensive, and often come from fishers themselves. Despite new technologies and industry recognition of the issue, bycatch is still a major problem. Not only does it cause avoidable 
    deaths and injuries, but the fishing methods can be harmful to the marine environments where they are employed.

   <h2>Hawksbill Turtle</h2>
   <p>
    Found in the tropical regions of all the world’s oceans, gulfs and seas- mostly in coral reefs, the Hawksbill Turtle’s population has been estimated to have declined by 80% over the last 
    century. Known to be a subject of heavy trafficking in the tourist trade in tropical regions for its meat and shells, these turtles are being killed mercilessly for quite a period of time. 
    The colourful shells of the Hawksbill Turtle, with beautiful patterns, make them a valuable item in the market, often sold as “tortoiseshell.” Even though in many countries harvesting of its 
    eggs is banned, the practice could not be ceased completely. The declination of its population has also resulted due to the degradation of coral reef species which the Hawksbill Turtle 
    primarily feed on. According to marine conservatives, this family of the turtle is the living representatives of reptiles that have existed in our oceans for the past hundred million years 
    and these turtles are vital for the existence of seagrass beds and coral reefs.

   <h2>Vaquita </h2>
   <p>
    An inhabitant of the shallow, murky waters off the shore of the Baja Peninsula in Mexico, Vaquita is the world’s smallest and critically endangered cetacean. This rare marine mammal in the 
    world is on the brink of extinction only after a half-century of its first sighting. Features of Vaquita include the dark rings around their eyes, lips with dark patches and a thin line from 
    mouth to dorsal fins. Extensive use of gill-netting for fishing in the Gulf of California has endangered this marine species, resulting in a gradual drop in population since the 1940s. The 
    gill-netting operation may have been ceased to exist in 1970, but the population fall persists for as much as 15% every year. According to reports, there is only a dozen of this marine 
    mammal left in the world since the percentage of decline in their population was as much as 90% since 2011.

   <h2>Blue Whale</h2>
   <p>
    The largest living mammal on earth, the blue whale belongs to the baleen whales and features more than 100 feet in length and around 200 tonnes in weight. There are at least three subspecies 
    of Blue whale and these could be found migrating from both poles in the oceans around the world. Sits on top of the food chain, whales have a significant role in maintaining a healthy marine 
    environment.Unfortunately, excessive commercial hunting has resulted in a decrease in its population drastically and now has posed a threat to its mere existence even though an international 
    ban was constituted in 1966. According to IUCN’s 2016 estimate, the global population of the Blue Whale is 10,000–25,000.

   <h2>Kemp’s Ridley Sea Turtle </h2>
   <p>
    The Kemp’s Ridley sea turtle, also known as the Atlantic Ridley sea turtle, is a rarest and smallest sea turtle and is endangered to a severe degree. Primarily found in the Gulf of Mexico, 
    the Kemp’s Ridley sea turtle often migrate to the Atlantic Ocean only to come back to lay eggs. This group turtle has a unique way of nesting habits. The female turtles arrive in large 
    numbers- a procession called Arribadas- in a single beach to lay eggs. Unfortunately, the conditions such as loss of habitat, marine pollution and entanglement in fishing nets etc. have 
    resulted in the huge decline of the population of the Kemp’s Ridley sea turtle. Thus, harvesting of eggs have been made illegal and research projects of incubating and hatching the eggs in 
    temperature-controlled rooms have been undertaken to save this endangered marine species.

   <h2>Steller Sea Lion</h2>
   <p>
    Evidently the largest member of the Otariid family and the fourth largest of all seal species, this eared seal could be located in the cold coastal waters of the North Pacific. Also known as 
    the northern sea lion, the species is named after Georg Wilhelm Steller, a naturalist who first discovered them in 1741. The high risk of predation by Killer Whales and fishing and harvest by 
    native Alaskans and Canadians for meat, oil, hides and other by-products make this marine life vulnerable to endanger. According to reports, its population has declined by more than 60% due 
    to both natural and human threats since the 1960s. However, the eastern Steller sea lion was omitted from the U.S. Endangered Species List in 2013 after their increasing population in recent 
    years.

   <h2>Hammerhead Shark</h2>
   <p>
    Traced in the tropical regions of the oceans around the world, the Hammerhead shark belongs to the family Sphyrnidae and was given the name because of its “hammer” shaped head. The Hammerhead 
    sharks typically have 0.9 to 6.0 m length and up to 580 kg weight. Known as aggressive hunters, these sharks are feed on smaller fish, squid crustaceans and octopuses, while there are reports 
    of unprovoked attacks on humans by the shark. These migratory sharks are subjected to being victimized for its fin. Even the process itself is horrifying as the sharks are caught by fishermen, 
    dragged on board and is cut off their fins while they are still breathing. The remaining carcass is thrown into the water and eventually, it bleeds to death. Albeit there is a ban imposed 
    upon shark finning in many countries, the result has been abortive as the demand and high price paid for it in the Asian market drives the illegal harvest system, endangering these marine 
    species’ survival.

   <h2>Fin whale</h2>
   <p>
    Also known as common rorqual, Fin whale is the second-largest mammal on the planet after Blue Whale. With a maximum length of 25.9 meters, the Fin Whale has an estimated weight of about 114 
    tonnes. Like all the other whales in our oceans, the Fin Whale is also a victim of hunting for a long period of time. According to estimates, the global population of Fin Whale ranges from 
    below 100,000 to around 119,000.Humpback Whale, another rorqual species, has also been listed as an endangered marine species. Before the introduction of whaling moratorium in 1966, these 
    species were hunted to extinction for its fur and flesh for meat, while the population dropped by 90%. Currently, around 2,500 Humpback Whale is believed to surviving in the world.

   <h2>Hector’s Dolphin</h2>
   <p>
    Found off the coast of New Zealand, Hector’s Dolphins are the smallest dolphins in the world and the prominent dolphin in the genus Cephalorhynchus. Mostly sighted around the South Island, 
    the world’s rarest dolphins’ features include black markings on the face, stocky bodies and creamy white throat and belly. One group of Hector’s Dolphin will be comprised of two to eight 
    members. Unfortunately, there is a significant decline in their population as trawl fisheries and bottom-set gill nets cause the death of these species. Most number of deaths happens in the 
    fishing nets. One of the two sub-species of Hector’s Dolphin, Maui’s dolphin, is considered to be a most endangered one. According to the survey conducted by the New Zealand Department of 
    Conservation in 2010-11, the estimated population of these dolphins is 55.

   <h2>Hawaiian Monk Seal</h2>
   <p>
    A native of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Hawaiian Monk Seal is one of the earless seals who live in the warm beaches, unlike other seals. This endangered marine mammal is one of the 
    two remaining in this species-monk seal- along with the Mediterranean monk seal, while third species from this family, the Caribbean monk seal, has already disappeared from the planet. 
    According to the recent research, there are only around 1,400 Hawaiian Monk Seal remaining on the Islands now. The existence of these seals is threatened by commercial hunting for meat, 
    oil and skin, attack from predators including tiger sharks, marine debris and entanglement in fishing nets.

   <h2>Green sea turtle</h2>
   <p>
    One of the largest sea turtles, Green Sea Turtle is a herbivore and can be found in the tropical and subtropical seas. The Green Sea Turtle’s name comes from the colour of the fat that found 
    underneath its carapace. Like many other turtle varieties, Green Sea Turtles also migrate from its hatching beaches to feeding grounds. Since these sea turtles are always been a popular food 
    item, the hunt for turtles and their eggs is threatening their lives. The loss of sandy beaches, marine population and careless fishing methods also have added to the decline of their 
    population.
